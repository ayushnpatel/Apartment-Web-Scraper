# Apartment Web Scraper

Developed a web scraper that will notify me of when a 2-bedroom apartment appears to be availabe in accordance to Apartment's website, due to first come first serve policy.
Dockerized project into a linux-based environment to upload onto AWS.
Set up effectively as a cron job, triggering the script to run every hour as a result of AWS Lambda CloudwWatch events.
